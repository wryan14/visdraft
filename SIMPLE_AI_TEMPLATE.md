# Simple AI Request Template

When requesting a new API, just copy and add this paragraph to your main request:

```
Please integrate this as a new API in the project following the simple API guide. This should work with the existing project structure and maintain any specific paths or requirements mentioned above. Please make it user-friendly and well-documented.
```

That's it! Just add this after explaining what you want your new feature to do. The AI will handle creating all the necessary files and structure while maintaining your specific requirements.
